              <p>Cooper and Adrianne met in the Summer of 2010 in San Francisco's Mission District, when they both participated in the plebian tradition of helping friends move in exchange for pizza and beer. Cooper caught a glimpse of Adrianne's backwards facing Ironboss cap as she hauled a bunch of cushions—Cooper would later hyperbolize this to include an entire couch—up the stairs, and thought to himself, "dang, that chick strong!" Adrianne didn't notice Cooper until later, chatting on the stoop after all of the records and comic books were safely inside their new home, but instantly found his good-natured humor and adorable brown eyes extremely charming—almost, as others have said, like a teddy bear. Later, they ate Indian pizza together and enthusiastically talked about viruses.</p>

              <img class='pull-right gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/IMG_1190.JPG'>
              <p>Some weeks passed and they went on their first date at Musée Mécanique, an old-timey arcade in Fisherman's Wharf where you can still play nickel and dime games (whoa!). Well, Adrianne wasn't so sure it was a date, but regardless, she appreciated the break from her graduate studies. Cooper, in an impromptu and sly manner, invited her to try an older game called "Rate Your Kiss," where two people hold onto metal handles as they kiss. Adrianne was skeptical but obliged. Afterwards, she still wasn't sure this was an actual date and awkwardly excused herself to make sure no one had stolen her bike parked outside. Somewhere around the eighth hour of this 'maybe' date, after dinner in North Beach and a trip to City Lights Books, Cooper and Adrianne figured out that they really did like each other and wanted to spend more time together.</p>
              <img class='pull-left gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/coop_winter_formal.jpg'>
              <p>At the time, Cooper was a web developer for Radical Designs, an awesome worker-owned cooperative that builds websites for non-profit and activist groups. Adrianne was midway through graduate school at UC Berkeley, studying cell division in budding yeast—a topic she loves—but found herself grappling with extremely difficult biochemical experiments. She was nearing burn-out after spending 80-90 hours per week in the lab, and decided to start lightening up a bit by hanging out with Cooper. On the weekends they did everything together, from geocaching, to hiking in Tilden (a regional park that runs along the crest of the East Bay hills) and around the coastal tide pools, to making awesome meals together. They went on oddball scavenger hunts around San Francisco. They went to baseball games when they could afford to, and celebrated the 2010 Giants World Series win, on Cooper's birthday, with a great big party at Thrillhouse Records. When they were broke (which was often) they made hot chocolate, built forts in the living room, and played Magic Cards or the original NES Zelda.  They listened to the rain on the roof. They went tubing down rivers with their friends, when the rivers in California still had water. And, of course, they went to lots and lots of shows together. Cooper started playing in a few bands after teaching himself drums: Government Denies Knowledge (yes, named after that line in the X-Files intro), Haikü (hardcore songs in under 10s!), and <a href='https://soundcloud.com/fantasy-world' target=_blank>Fantasy World</a> (worth a listen!). 
              <img class='pull-right gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/ad6.jpg'>
              As Occupy Oakland developed in 2011-2012, they both took part in direct actions, although Cooper was tear gassed far more than Adrianne. They were unlawfully arrested on the same day for protesting, and Cooper patiently waited at Santa Rita jail until Adrianne was finally released, days later. Afterwards, they took care of each other and helped each other recover. In short, they went through life together. They talked and laughed and cried and fell in love. Even Nooshi, the affectionate but shy cat buddy Adrianne's had since college, welcomed Cooper into her life.</p>
              <p>Cooper moved from San Francisco into Adrianne's Berkeley apartment in 2013, shortly after Adrianne finally graduated from Cal with her PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology. While not quite a tiny home, it is affectionately referred to as "the single-wide on a foundation." Although they sometimes nostalgically recall the open spaces and rolling pastures of their youth spent in Napa, Sonoma, and Texas, Cooper and Adrianne wouldn't rather be anywhere else. In 2014, Cooper was offered his dream job as a Staff Technologist at the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation), a phenomenal non-profit organization based in San Francisco that advocates for digital rights and privacy. Adrianne, who is still seeking her dream job, is thrilled for Cooper and extremely proud of him and his work. They are unabashedly in love with each other and look forward to continuing to build a home together, however big or small, and certainly in need of a dog.</p>

            <h2>The Proposal</h2>
            <img class='pull-left gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/ad2.jpg'>
            <img class='pull-right gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/IMG_0731.JPG' style='width:140px; max-height:none;'>
            <p>Cooper proposed on August 16th, 2014, at beautiful Big Basin Redwoods State Park in the Santa Cruz Valley. It was a gorgeous day, and our first Saturday together after we'd both been travelling separately for several weeks. When we woke up, Coop asked if I wanted an early anniversary present (the fourth anniversary of our first date was in 10 days or so). Of course I said yes, and he gave me a sealed manila envelope marked "confidential." Inside was a single sheet of paper with 7 haikus on it: "A treasure hunt!" he explained. Each haiku presented a clue that directed me to a different location around the Bay Area, from a mission in Sonoma to Ed Ricketts' lab in Monterey. "Do I have to go to all of these places for the final answer to make sense?" I asked, wondering if I needed to think about changing the oil in my car before we departed. "No no, you should be able to solve the whole thing on paper, and just go to one spot," replied Cooper. Over breakfast at a diner, and with green highlighter (the only pen I had) in hand, I tried to deduce where these haikus were leading me. After some deliberation on what triangular numbers are (really?! I hadn't heard of those since 7th grade!), I finally understood—we were to go to the Mother of the Forest tree in Big Basin.</p>
            <p>It took us almost two hours to drive there, and Cooper fidgeted the whole time. It was a beautiful day and a beautiful drive, though, and reminded me of all of the adventures we'd been on together. "Big Basin," I tried to distract Cooper, "I think my mom's mom visited there during WWII, when she was stationed in Santa Cruz as a Sergeant in the W.A.C. In fact, I think I have a wooden postcard she sent her dad from the park." "Huh," said Cooper, and went back to fidgeting. We finally reached the parking lot of Big Basin and asked a ranger for directions to The Mother of The Forest. "Right over there, there's a little path that will take you around to it," dude pointed and said. We park and get a map for a quarter from the box at the trail head. We take the long way around—the whole trail is under a mile, but we wanted to see all of the trees on it, and Mother of the Forest is the last one. The trees are enormous, so old and spectacular against a clear blue sky, reminding us of what a gift life is and how crazy it is that we're here. Cooper and I talk about The Shire a bunch, and then I bore him with the marvels of xylem and phloem, and how it's hard to contemplate them working on such a huge scale. Fifty or so yards before our destination on the trail is Father of the Forest—the exact tree pictured on the postcard I have from my grandmother to her dad back in upstate New York, postmarked October 3rd, 1945. I am ecstatic to be in a place my grandmother once was.</p>
              <img class='pull-left gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/IMG_1513.JPG' style='max-width:none; height: 250px;'>
            <p>After taking numerous selfies at the Father of the Forest, we proceed down the path to the Mother of the Forest...except there's a bunch of tourists taking pictures there. "Let's wait a little bit for them to do their thing," Cooper says. And so we hang back, looking at the beautiful canopy above us and around us. Finally, the tourists leave, just as it is getting to be dusk. At least there are no other people in sight. "So where's the treasure?" I ask Cooper, wondering what this is all building up to. I couldn't believe that he could hide anything too important in such a well-travelled place. "Uh, why don't you go look over there?" he says, pointing to a fallen tree and a bunch of smallish stumps. I pretend like I'm looking for a few seconds before he asks me to turn around. And Cooper is there, on one knee, with a box. "The treasure is you," he says, "will you marry me?"</p>
              <img class='pull-right gallery-img img-responsive' src='/images/ad4.jpg'>
            <p>It was an incredible proposal, and so sentimental. The engagement ring Cooper chose had been his paternal great-grandmother's. It is gorgeous and of a semi-mysterious heritage because it is so old—I can only hope to do its legacy proud. I am still baffled by the connection between that spot in the hills of Santa Cruz, and my own family from the other side of the country. After we sealed the engagement with an emphatic YES!!! and many kisses and blurry cell phone pictures, we headed back to the park store for a couple of drinks. Inside, I found the same wooden postcard my grandmother had mailed her dad nearly 70 years ago! And, we later learned, it was Cooper's maternal great-grandmother's birthday that day! So many mothers and so much family history! We were, and are, very excited to be a part of it, and to continue to make our own memories together.</p>

        <h1>The Ceremony & Location</h1>
      </div>
      <div class='container'>
        <div class='row'>
          <div class='col-md-12'>
            <p>We've decided to get married at <a href='http://www.sequoiaretreatcenter.com/' target=_blank>Sequoia Retreat Center in Ben Lomond</a>, a small town ~10 miles north of Santa Cruz, and ~75 miles southeast of San Francisco. We chose this venue because it is absolutely stunning, natural, and close to many of our friends and Cooper's family members, while still bearing significance for Adrianne's family. We realize that for many—especially family members and friends from the East Coast and Texas—this will be a destination wedding. We absolutely respect your time and resources, and do not want to over-extend them, although we would love to celebrate this special day with you!</p>
            <p>We have rented the entire retreat center for the weekend of October 16-18. Our ceremony will take place in a redwood grove and will be officiated by our good and trusted friend, Zoe. Following the ceremony, there will be a cocktail hour, dinner, and reception on-site. These will occur at a lodge that is not far from the ceremony site, although it is a slightly hilly climb by foot.</p>
            <h2>But wait, there's more...</h2>
            <p>First, please keep an eye on this website. We have not finalized the schedule for the day of the wedding yet, but we aim to start the ceremony between 3-4pm. We're also planning on hosting some other activities on October 17th at the venue (like skill-shares and games), so please stay tuned for a more detailed schedule.</p>
            <p>The Sequoia Retreat Center is in the Santa Cruz Hills (San Lorenzo Valley). While beautiful, there is some elevation associated with this venue. At the ceremony site, there are ~20 steps down to reach the site. At the reception site, Las Alas Lodge, there are ~10 steps separating the outdoor dinner location from the indoor lodge (where the restrooms are located and where the reception will largely occur). Las Alas Lodge is perhaps 50 feet above the ceremony site in elevation, but it is very manageable for healthy folks. For folks who need assistance, we will run a shuttle between the parking site, ceremony site, and reception site. The drive is not more than a minute between each of these places, but we do not want you to be hurting or exhausted getting to and from our wedding!</p>
            <p>Please dress however you feel comfortable. The bridal party will be wearing semi-formal attire, and we invite you to either "dress up" with us, or wear whatever makes you feel awesome. The MOST important thing is that you wear comfortable shoes! If you would like to wear spiky heels, please save them for the reception/dance floor and bring a more comfortable pair of shoes along with you! There really are so many steps and earthy places to sink a heel into—spiky heels would not be comfortable. Wedges and flats and chunky heels and boots should be fine, though.</p>
            <p>There are cabins available for rental at the venue, but they are quite basic. There are also hotel rooms blocked off at a Hilton in nearby Scott's Valley. More info on this can be found under accommodations. Unfortunately, no dogs are allowed at the venue.</p>
            <p>We'll be setting up some games for people to play on Saturday before the cermony (board games, lawn games). We'd also love to facilitate some skill-shares (small group workshops where people can learn a skill). If you have a game you love and would like to bring, or a skill you would like to share, please contact Cooper and Adrianne at <a href='mailto:cna@awesomeweddingtime.com'>cna@awesomeweddingtime.com</a>. Thanks!</p>

            <h2>Sequoia Retreat Center</h2>

            <p>The Sequoia Retreat Center has a number of cabins available for rental for Friday and Saturday nights (they can only be rented for two nights, not just one). Cabins range in occupancy from 2-5 people—the rates go down if more people are in a cabin. Cabin rental fees include a hot breakfast on both days (we'll bring the mimosas!). The cabins are adequate, with power and a bathroom in each one, but they are on the rustic side. Most cabins have a full bed, a twin bed, and a set of bunk beds all in one room. <a href='http://www.sequoiaretreatcenter.com/#!cabins/ckwb' target=_blank>You can view pictures of the cabins here.</a><p>

            <p>There is also limited tent camping space in Peace Park, a grassy lawn that's part of the venue. There is outdoor power available here, and a bathroom not too far away. There is still a small charge for camping, and breakfast on both days is included in the fee.</p>

            <p>If you would like to book a cabin or tent camp, please contact Cooper or Adrianne at <a href='mailto:cna@awesomeweddingtime.com'>cna@awesomeweddingtime.com</a> and we'll pass along a link to do so. We'll do our absolute best to accommodate everyone's preferences for what type of cabin they get. Again, unfortunately dogs aren't allowed at Sequoia Retreat Center—we wish it were different, too.</p>

            <p>If you are staying in a cabin or tent, this is what you will need to bring:
            <ul>
            <li>headlamp for getting around the terrain at SRC</li>
            <li>comfy shoes</li>
            <li>hoodie or sweater (for night-time)</li>
            <li>water bottle (nalgene/canteen)</li>
            <li>flask, if you choose (but please keep it hidden)</li>
            <li>ice if you want it (there are no ice machines at SRC)</li>

          <h2>Other Accommodations</h2>
          <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12'>
            <h3>Hilton Scott's Valley</h3>
            <p>We've reserved a block of rooms at the Hilton Scott's Valley (~9 miles away from the venue, and just off CA-17). Discounted rates are available for the week of October 13th-20th. <a href='http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/S/SJCSVHF-PIQUW-20151013/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG' target=_blank>Please click here</a> for more information on how to book rooms.</p>

          <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12'>
            <h3>Elsewhere</h3>
            <p>There are several other hotels in the Ben Lomond and Scott's Valley area, as well as in Santa Cruz (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=hotels&find_loc=Ben+Lomond%2C+CA&ns=1' target=_blank>see here for hotels around Ben Lomond</a>). We've also had some luck finding listings on airbnb.com and vrbo.com. If you're interested in renting something bigger, like a house, but can't fill it up, please contact Cooper and Adrianne at <a href='mailto:cna@awesomeweddingtime.com'>cna@awesomeweddingtime.com</a>. We may be able to facilitate some house- or rental-shares.</p>

          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12'>
            <h3>Airports</h3>
            <p>There are three airports in the Bay Area, San Francisco (SFO), San Jose (SJC), and Oakland (OAK). SFO and SJC are the closest airports to the venue (~1:15min and ~50min away from the venue, respectively), and OAK is ~1:20min away. These times are all without traffic, which can be quite heavy in the Bay Area. SFO and OAK are definitely the larger airports, but we did find decent fares for cross-country flights into SJC, so it might be worth a shot. We've found kayak.com helpful in the past as a search engine for fares, and Virgin Airlines can have some good deals into SFO if you book a decent amount of time in advance.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12'>
            <h3>Driving</h3>
            <p>Sequoia Retreat Center is about 75 miles southeast of either San Francisco or Oakland, but traffic and CA-17 tend to make the drive longer than anticipated. If you plan on driving, have extra room in your car, and would willing to help other folks get down to Ben Lomond, please contact <a href='mailto:cna@awesomeweddingtime.com'>cna@awesomeweddingtime.com</a>. Likewise, if you need a ride from the Bay Area down to Ben Lomond, please contact us—we'd like to be able to set up some ride-shares to help get everyone down there.</p>

            <h3> Big Sur </h3>
            <p> Big Sur was first settled by the Spanish in the 1830s, but developed its first large settlements due to the Gold Rush. The construction of Highway One in the 1930s transformed Big Sur, making its beauty accessible to all rather than just the most intrepid. Get a feel for Big Sur's history by visiting Andrew Molera State Park, home to Big Sur's oldest building, and that famous Big Sur lighthouse, Point Sur Lighthouse. </p>

            <h3> 17-Mile Drive </h3>
            <p> 17-Mile Drive The best time to take the 17-Mile Drive is fall or spring, when skies are clearer. For the best chance of clear skies, go in mid to late afternoon. Even though it's written on the bottom of the 17-Mile Drive entry fee receipt, no one looks, so it's a little-known fact that you can get a refund. If you spend more than $25 at any of the Pebble Beach Company restaurants along the 17-Mile Drive, they'll deduct the fee from your bill. We recommend Roy's restaurant at the Inn at Spanish Bay for their great views and service. </p>

            <h3> Cannery Row </h3>
            <p> Monterey's Cannery Row was officially named "Cannery Row" in 1958 to honor John Steinbeck for his novels, Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). Both were the basis for the 1982 movie Cannery Row, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. Cannery Row is also mentioned in Bob Dylan's song "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Pacific Biological Laboratories, a biological supply house, was located at 800 Ocean View Avenue (now 800 Cannery Row) from 1928 to 1948, and operated by Edward F. Ricketts, who was the inspiration for several characters in Steinbeck novels. The laboratory is still preserved. Across from the laboratory still exists a Chinese-American-owned store mentioned in both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, as well as a vacant lot that was the "home" of some of the homeless characters in the novel. </p>
